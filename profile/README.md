## 📖 About Us

**Shema** is a community within Youth With A Mission (YWAM) dedicated to ending Bible poverty. We focus on **Oral Bible Translation (OBT)**, recognizing that many language groups prefer oral communication over written text.

Our mission is to help communities:
* **Internalize** Scripture through storytelling and memory.
* **Translate** the Bible into natural, spoken forms of their language.
* **Celebrate** the message of God in the language that speaks to their hearts.

## 🛠️ Our Technology

We build open-source software to support the OBT workflow: web apps for drafting, transcription, and verification; Flutter mobile apps for field work; and AI/ML tools for acoustic tokenization, model training, and agent-assisted analysis.
