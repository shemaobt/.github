## 📖 About us

**Shema** is a community within Youth With A Mission (YWAM) focused on ending Bible poverty through **Oral Bible Translation (OBT)**. We believe that for many language communities, Scripture is best received and shared in spoken form—through stories, conversation, and celebration—not only on the page.

We partner with communities to:

- **Internalize** Scripture through storytelling, repetition, and memory.
- **Translate** the Bible into natural, spoken language that sounds like them.
- **Celebrate** God’s Word in the language and format that speaks to their hearts.

If that vision resonates with you, we’d love to connect. Our [website](https://www.shemaywam.com/) and [documentation](https://docs.shemaywam.com/) are great places to start.

## 🛠️ What we build

We build **open-source software** that supports the full OBT workflow: from drafting and meaning maps to recording in the field, transcription, and AI-assisted analysis.

- **Translation & field tools** — Web and Flutter apps for facilitators and validators: voice translation, mentorship tracking, Tripod Studio for generating and reviewing oral Scripture, and data collection for monolingual recordings.
- **Meaning Maps & drafting** — Tools that help teams work from Biblical semantic structure (e.g. BHSA-based meaning maps) and generate drafts for oral translation.
- **ML & speech** — Acoustic tokenization pipelines, model training (e.g. XLSR/MMS/XEUS, vocoders, pair translation experiments), and demos for low-resource transcription and acoustemes.
- **Docs & process** — [Documentation](https://docs.shemaywam.com/) for systems, architecture, and processes; [RFCs](https://github.com/shemaobt/rfcs) for proposals and decisions.

We use **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **Flutter** across the stack. You can browse all of our repositories in the [Shema GitHub organization](https://github.com/shemaobt).
